**Status**: COMPLETE

### **v5.3.2 - Active Exercise Card Architecture Overhaul**
**Date**: Previous session
**Achievements**: Fixed card height shift, established dual color system, eliminated !important flags
**Status**: Foundation for subsequent spacing fixes

## CRITICAL DISCOVERIES

### **Global CSS Reset Constraint (v5.3.6)**
Found that `* { margin: 0; padding: 0; }` combined with component-level !important declarations prevents normal margin control, requiring architectural workarounds.

### **CSS Table Layout Stability (v6.2)**
CSS Grid's content-based column balancing causes positioning instability. CSS table with `table-layout: fixed` provides content-independent equal columns, eliminating layout shifts.

### **CSS Import Order Dependencies (v5.3.5)**
Import sequence in main style files affects cascade specificity, requiring careful ordering and exclusion selectors for dual-mode patterns.

### **CEMENT System Established (v5.3.2)**
Implemented ðŸ”’ markers to protect critical architectural decisions that solve specific bugs or timing issues.
