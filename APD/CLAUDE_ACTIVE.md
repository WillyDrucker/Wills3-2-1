# CLAUDE ACTIVE WORKING NOTES

## Purpose

This file serves as a temporary scratch pad for active session work. Use this file for:
- Working notes that don't yet belong in SESSION_HANDOFF or PROJECT_NOTES
- Temporary discoveries and observations
- Items that need to be organized later
- Session-specific debugging information

This file can be purged and cleaned as needed. It's an extension of SESSION_HANDOFF and PROJECT_NOTES to keep those files cleaner and more focused.

## Current Session Notes

### Interactive Workout Selectors - In Progress (2025-01-24)

**Status**: Selector overlay behavior working, scroll jump issue persisting

**Current Issue - Modal Scroll Jump**:
- Opening Edit Workout modal jumps My Data page to top
- Closing Edit Workout modal also jumps to top
- Problem: `modalService.open()` → `renderAll()` → clears innerHTML → resets scroll
- Attempted fixes:
  1. setTimeout after modal open - didn't work
  2. Scroll preservation in refreshMyDataPageDisplay() - wrong level
  3. Scroll preservation in renderAll() - still jumping
- Root cause: `ui.mainContent.innerHTML = ""` at line 110 of main.js resets scroll before save
- Need different approach - possibly prevent renderAll() for this modal

**Completed Work**:

1. **Edit Pen Button Removal**:
   - Removed edit pen button from workout selectors
   - Archived button component in uiComponents.js for future reuse
   - Restored 16px spacing below workout logs

2. **Completion Timestamp System**:
   - Added `completed_timestamp` column to database (migration 20251023)
   - Captures exact moment workout is marked committed
   - Displays as "Completed: 9:45 AM" in gray/green styling
   - Format: 12-hour time with AM/PM

3. **Interactive Workout Selectors**:
   - Click selector to activate with blue glow effect
   - Shows Cancel and Edit buttons below results
   - Mutes all other selectors when one active
   - Click outside or inside selector to close
   - Two-step click: first click closes active, second opens new

4. **Button Overlay System**:
   - Buttons use `position: absolute` (like `.options-list` pattern)
   - Blue border extends to surround buttons
   - No `top` property - natural position but out of flow
   - `z-index: 200` overlays on content below
   - Square bottom corners on active selector connect to button container

5. **Fast Re-render Pattern**:
   - Created `refreshMyDataPageDisplay()` - no database load
   - Separated from `renderMyDataPage()` which loads from DB
   - Instant selector open/close (no lag)
   - Click-outside-to-close using document-level listener

6. **Database Cleanup**:
   - Migration `20251024_delete_workouts_before_oct22.sql`
   - Removed old data causing selector issues
   - Applied via Supabase Dashboard

7. **Background Scroll Prevention**:
   - Added `html.is-modal-open { overflow: hidden; }`
   - Prevents mouse wheel scrolling background when modal open
   - Applied to ALL modals via _modals.css

**Files Modified** (11 total):
- `my-data.templates.calendarDay.js` - Interactive selector template with buttons
- `my-data.selectors.css` - Active/muted states, button overlay styling
- `my-data.day-label.css` - Two-line label system, completion timestamp
- `my-data.history-spacing.css` - Adjusted margins for two-line labels
- `my-data.index.js` - refreshMyDataPageDisplay(), click-outside-to-close
- `actionHandlers.modals.js` - Selector handlers, two-step behavior
- `historyService.js` - Completion timestamp capture
- `workoutSyncService.save.js` - Save completion timestamp to DB
- `workoutSyncService.load.js` - Load completion timestamp from DB
- `_modals.css` - Background scroll prevention
- `main.js` - Scroll preservation in renderAll() (not working yet)
- `state.js` - Added selectedHistoryWorkoutId

**Technical Discoveries**:

1. **Options-List Pattern**:
   - `.options-list` doesn't set `top` property
   - Uses `position: absolute` with `width: 100%`
   - Removes from flow while keeping natural position
   - This is the correct pattern for overlay without push

2. **RenderAll Flow Issue**:
   - `modalService.open()` → `_renderAll()` → full page re-render
   - `ui.mainContent.innerHTML = ""` resets scroll before we can save
   - Saving scroll before renderAll doesn't work because DOM already cleared
   - Need to prevent renderAll or use different modal approach

3. **Click-Outside Pattern**:
   - Document-level listener with `closest()` check
   - Remove listener before adding to prevent duplicates
   - Works for any absolutely positioned overlay element

**Next Steps**:
- Resolve scroll jump issue (may need modal service refactor)
- Test all selector interactions after scroll fix
- Verify completion timestamp on all workout types
- Test database migration cleanup results

**Files to Watch**:
- `main.js` - renderAll() scroll preservation attempts
- `modalService.js` - Modal open/close behavior
- `my-data.index.js` - My Data page rendering and scroll management
