# CLAUDE ACTIVE WORKING NOTES

## Purpose

This file serves as a temporary scratch pad for active session work. Use this file for:
- Working notes that don't yet belong in SESSION_HANDOFF or PROJECT_NOTES
- Temporary discoveries and observations
- Items that need to be organized later
- Session-specific debugging information

This file can be purged and cleaned as needed. It's an extension of SESSION_HANDOFF and PROJECT_NOTES to keep those files cleaner and more focused.
