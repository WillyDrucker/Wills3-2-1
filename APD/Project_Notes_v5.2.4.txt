# Project_Notes_v5.2.4.txt

## Focus
Stabilizing the **My Data** page headers and margins using the **Config card** as reference, while restoring the **Training History** selector (which was broken during earlier refactors).

---

## Changes & Fixes

### Headers
- **Performance** header:
  - Now consistently **16px top / 7px bottom** (token-driven).
  - Fixed earlier drift caused by border + inline style overrides.

- **Training History** header:
  - Aligned to the same **16/7 rhythm**.
  - Applied border-compensated token padding (like Config card).
  - Ensured descenders are protected with a bottom padding token.

- **Workout Logs** header:
  - Locked to **16px inset top** and **16px gap below** divider.
  - Chevron buttons and date text now aligned in a single flex row with the header text.
  - Resolved previous spacing drift (24–27px).

---

### Margins & Layout
- All card content containers normalized to **16px L/R insets** with `calc(var(--space-m) - var(--card-border-width, 2px))`.
- **Day headers (e.g., “Monday: Chest”)** placed **16px below** top rail.
- **Exercises**:
  - **7px gap** from day header to first exercise.
  - **16px between exercises**.
- **Dividers**:
  - Top rail (under header): **0/0** (header margin handles spacing).
  - Inner rails: **16px / 16px** spacing so placeholder text isn’t clipped.
- **Placeholder text** (“Remaining Workout Day”) uses informational gray token, italicized.

---

### Training History Selector
- Original **selector markup restored** (summary “My Workout” + options “Conditioning” and “Stretching”) via `createSelectorHTML`.
- Fixed broken state where selector was stretched across the screen and always open.
- Behavior restored:
  - **Closed by default** with compact summary.
  - **Opens only** when `.selector.is-open` is applied.
- Selector summary sits exactly **7px below header** (token-driven).

---

## Cemented
- **Header rhythm cemented:** visual 16px top / 7px below, using border-compensated tokens.
- **Exercise log layout cemented:** mirrors active workout log structure for historical consistency.
- **Selector pattern cemented:** must use `createSelectorHTML` for stability and consistency with app-wide dropdowns.
