v5.1.0 -> v5.1.1 (Session Summary)

- ARCHITECTURAL UPGRADE (Development Workflow): Transitioned the entire project to a professional, Git-based workflow.
  - Established a local development environment with Visual Studio Code.
  - Initialized a Git repository for version control.
  - Created a private GitHub repository for secure cloud backup.
  - Integrated CodeSandbox as a live preview server and remote workstation linked to the GitHub repository.

- ARCHITECTURAL UPGRADE (Module System): Implemented a definitive `importmap` in `index.html`. This resolves all "bare specifier" module imports (e.g., "state", "services/"), making the native ES Module system robust, reliable, and eliminating all module-loading `MIME type` errors.

- ARCHITECTURAL REFACTOR ("Rhythm & Flow" System): Instituted a new, token-based layout system to serve as the single source of truth for all application spacing and typography, eliminating brittle, one-off CSS rules.
  - Established the "Grouped Stack System" using nested flexbox containers with the `gap` property as the new gold standard for card layouts.
  - Perfected the system by using `line-height: 0.7` for optical tuning of headers, eliminating "invisible" spacing issues.
  - Created new, purpose-driven spacing tokens (`--space-header-offset`) for clarity.
  - Proved and cemented this new system by completely refactoring the `config-card` component to be pixel-perfect according to the new standard.

- ARCHITECTURAL SIMPLIFICATION (Config Card): Eliminated the over-engineered, multi-file template structure for the Config Card. All template logic was consolidated into a single, more robust `config-card.template.js` file, deleting three obsolete files and removing multiple points of failure.

- BUG FIX (CRITICAL): Resolved a fatal application crash caused by a mismatched function signature in `ui.js` and its calls in various templates. This fix restored the app header, including the Home and Hamburger Menu icons, to full functionality.
