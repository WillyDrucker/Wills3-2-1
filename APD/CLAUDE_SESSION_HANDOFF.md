# CLAUDE SESSION HANDOFF

**Date**: 2025-09-22
**Status**: ⚠️ PARTIAL FIX - Fuel gauge normal mode still showing yellow instead of dynamic colors
**Next Session**: Debug fuel gauge color application in normal mode

## CURRENT ISSUE SUMMARY

### **Problem**
Fuel gauge segments in normal mode are still displaying yellow instead of dynamically changing based on Current Focus selector.

### **Work Completed This Session**
✅ **Root cause identified**: Missing CSS completed state rules
✅ **CSS structure fixed**: Added all missing animation and completed state rules
✅ **Template logic updated**: Normal mode now uses `currentTimerColorClass` directly
✅ **Dual modes verified**: Static color schemes working correctly

### **What's Still Broken**
❌ **Normal mode segments**: Still showing yellow (`text-deviation` color) regardless of Current Focus setting
❌ **Expected behavior**: Should show green when Current Focus = Today, yellow when Current Focus = Different day

### **Files Modified This Session**
- `src/styles/components/_fuel-gauge.css` - Added dynamic color rules for `text-plan`/`text-deviation`
- `src/features/active-exercise-card/active-exercise-card.templates.fuelGauge.js` - Updated to use `currentTimerColorClass` directly

## NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES

1. **Debug CSS rule application** - Check if `is-complete-text-plan` classes are being applied
2. **Verify currentTimerColorClass values** - Confirm Current Focus selector is setting correct values
3. **Test color cascade** - Ensure new CSS rules have proper specificity
4. **Final testing** - Verify fuel gauge colors match timer colors in all scenarios

## ARCHITECTURE STATUS

✅ **Dual color system** - Timer and header colors working independently
✅ **Static dual modes** - Superset/Partner using correct hardcoded colors
✅ **CSS foundation** - All animation states and completed rules now present
⚠️ **Dynamic normal mode** - Logic implemented but not visually working yet

---

**Key Achievement**: Established complete CSS animation foundation and template logic structure. Issue is now isolated to color rule application/cascading in normal mode only.
