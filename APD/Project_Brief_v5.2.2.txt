Project Brief v5.2.2
====================

Overview:
---------
Will's 3-2-1 is a streamlined, state-driven web application for tracking workouts.
The UI adheres to strict spacing, typography, and token rules for simplicity and consistency.

Non-negotiables:
----------------
- UI strictly reflects appState (Event → Update → Re-render).
- Tokenized layout + .stack gaps only; no ad-hoc pixel nudges unless tokenized.
- No !important, no sub-1 line-height, no structure changes.
- Global rhythm: 16px inset; 7px header→selector; 16px between groups.
- Do not change colors, tokens, or fonts unless explicitly asked.
- Inactive spacing is locked at 16/16 and must not change.

Latest Updates:
---------------
- Home page and My Data page unified to 16/7 rhythm with descender-safe cemented rules.
- Cemented comment methodology refined: top-of-file block with intent + token math; concise inline notes.
- Future tuning uses tokens only (no arbitrary overrides).

Delivery Protocol:
------------------
- Provide full files (unzipped) for any modified or new files.
- Return each as a downloadable artifact.
- Provide concise summary first, then full files, when possible.
- Avoid extra code in explanations beyond summary and file outputs.
