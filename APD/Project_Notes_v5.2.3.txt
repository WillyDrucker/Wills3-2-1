Project_Notes_v5.2.3 (updated)

Scope this session
- Restore tokenized spacing/typography across My Data: Performance, Training History, Workout Logs.
- Fix regressions from CSS drift and selector mismatch; re-align to 16/16 gutters and 16→7 header rhythm.

Root causes found
1) CSS truncation: lower half of my-data.style.css (headers/rails/exercise blocks) was missing, so page fell back to defaults.
2) Selector drift: calendar view now emits classes (history-log-item, log-item-exercise-name, etc.) that old CSS didn’t target.
3) Hook missing: cards in My Data lacked .my-data-card, so header rhythm rules didn’t apply.

Fixes applied (ready in repo artifacts provided during session)
- Restored the missing CSS and added a small compatibility block for new class names.
- Reasserted token rhythm:
  • Content top to H2: visual 16px (14px internal + 2px border). 
  • H2 to next control (buttons/selector): 7px via sibling rule, preventing double-counted margins.
  • Left/right rails inside cards: 16px.
- Workout Logs presentation:
  • Day on left (1rem/600), Date on right (1rem/600) using .date-text + flex ordering.
  • Exercise name on its own line (1rem/600, colored like “Today’s Workout”).
  • Each set row beneath: 50px left indent for count; results right-aligned; keep nowrap.
  • Placeholder: “Remaining Workout Day” italic, informational gray.
- Calendar chevrons restored as buttons; 32×32 spec retained; disabled is muted gray.

Debugging utilities (optional; remove before shipping)
- debug.css + my-data probe variable to confirm CSS load/parse.
- style-audit.css + style-audit.js to overlay 16px rails and print per‑card top/gap/left measurements.

Outstanding to confirm next session
- Visual audit with the style-audit kit on: Performance, Training History, Workout Logs.
- Verify all 1.15rem text upgraded to 1.25rem across app (home, config, active exercise, results, superset states).
- Ensure no separators are offset (all 16px rails, no 30px stray margins).
- Chevron buttons: confirm 32×32, black chevrons, muted gray when disabled.
- Remove debug assets after confirmation; then CEMENT comments in touched files.

Cement plan (after confirmation)
- Add a brief cement block at top of my-data.style.css and my-data.templates.calendarView.js documenting tokens used:
  • Rails: 16px; Header rhythm: 16 top / 7 next; Set-row indent: 50px; No !important; No ad-hoc spacing.
