Guiding Philosophies
SUPER STUPID SIMPLE (SSS): The user experience must be effortless and guided.
REMOVE, DON'T ADD: When faced with complexity, the first instinct should be to simplify or remove.

Non‑negotiables
- UI strictly reflects appState (Event → Update → Re‑render).
- Tokenized layout + `.stack` gaps only; no ad‑hoc pixel nudges unless tokenized.
- No `!important`, no sub‑1 line‑height, no structure changes.
- Global rhythm: 16px inset; 7px header→selector; 16px between groups.
- Do not change colors, tokens, or fonts unless explicitly asked.
- Inactive spacing is locked at 16/16 and must not change.

Delivery Protocol
- Provide **full files (unzipped)** for **any and all files you modify or add** — no limit.
- Return each as a downloadable artifact.
- Provide concise summary first, then full files, when possible.
- To reduce session token count, keep prompts concise, to a minimum, no extra code or explanations necessary outside of summary and full file to be downloaded.
- Do not provide ZIPs full files only.
- Do not provide extra files if no code was changed.

Code Comments
- Reduce code comments when possible, keep concise comments
- Cement rules should only be used for architectural or important items that constant change, use sparingly.
- No version numbers in code, remove if seen while working on active file.
