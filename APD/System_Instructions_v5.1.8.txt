Non‑negotiables
- UI strictly reflects appState (Event → Update → Re‑render).
- Tokenized layout + `.stack` gaps only; no ad‑hoc pixel nudges unless tokenized.
- No `!important`, no sub‑1 line‑height, no structure changes.
- Global rhythm: 16px inset; 7px header→selector; 16px between groups.
- Do not change colors, tokens, or fonts unless explicitly asked.
- Inactive spacing is locked at 16/16 and must not change.

Delivery Protocol
- Provide **full files (unzipped)** for **any and all files you modify or add** — no limit.
- Return each as a downloadable artifact.
- After files, add a short “Why these changes” tying to the Bible/tokens.

Task (v5.1.8)
- Target: **Active (normal workout)** spacing to exactly **16/16/16** with **active‑only** scoped selectors/tokens (e.g., `.action-prompt-block.is-resting` under `#card-action-area.stack`). Do not affect inactive or superset/partner.
- Ensure: 
  - Residual spacers/margins inside `.is-resting` are neutralized or token‑controlled.
  - `.timer-container` and `.action-button-group` contribute no extra vertical space.
  - Keep `line-height: var(--lh-normal)` on text (no hacks).
- Validate inactive still measures 16/16 after changes.
