Project Notes v5.2.5
===========================

Goals:
------
- Merge Training History + Workout Logs into a single History card.
- History card should include:
  * Header: History text + calendar range + chevrons on the same line.
  * Selector immediately below header.
  * Day list and logs inside.
- Follow tokenized spacing (16/7/16), no ad-hoc margins, no hacks.

Issues Encountered & Fixes:
---------------------------
1. Broken links for file drops
   - Needed to use sandbox: links or inline full files.
   - Next time: provide only the single changed file unless others are required.

2. `getWeekRange` ReferenceError
   - Import didn’t resolve.
   - Lesson: Don’t import utils directly if other components already compute values. 
     Instead, pass through a proxy element (history-week-proxy) and sync it.

3. SyntaxError in my-data.index.js
   - Cause: bad regex replacement injected stray tokens.
   - Lesson: For injection, keep edits surgical; don’t rely on regex lumps.

4. Missing export (handleClearHistory)
   - Other services expected this export.
   - Fix: Added a stub export.
   - Lesson: Always check imports in related files (like actionService.js) before pruning/merging.

5. Empty CSS ruleset warning
   - Harmless but flagged.
   - Fix: Remove empty blocks or add a harmless tokenized rule.
   - Lesson: Keep CSS tidy; no “comment-only” blocks.

6. Syntax errors in calendarView.js
   - Caused by half-cut removal of header/footer.
   - Fix: rebuild file carefully with balanced template strings and containerClass declaration.
   - Lesson: When stripping markup in a template literal, always confirm matching backticks + semicolons.

Current State:
--------------
- History card is functional.
- calendarView.js now outputs only the body (proxy + container) with no extra header/footer.
- CSS improvements are in place for spacing and log item layout.
- Learned that sometimes only one file should change; changing many increases syntax error risk.

Resetting all-app-unify branch in VS Code:
------------------------------------------
1. Open Source Control panel (Ctrl+Shift+G).
2. Checkout the all-app-unify branch from the bottom-left branch menu.
3. Open Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P), type "Git: Reset".
4. Choose "Git: Reset (Hard)" and select the commit (latest remote HEAD if desired).
5. Confirm. Branch is now clean and matches the chosen commit.
