    "plan_information": "Will's 3-2-1 is the standard, recommended, workout plan with strength as the primary goal.  This plan is designed from the core principal that all body parts can be broken down into 3 major muscle groups, and those groups are further targetted for optimal gains.  No overtraining, no undertraining, the perfect amount needed to achieve the most performance humanly possible week-after-week.  This is a one-body-part-per-day approach, utilizing complex resting strategies, targetted exercise overlap and optimal use of time all rolled up into one super stupid simple program to follow.  The Will's 3-2-1 program achieves maximum health, functionality and longevity with the highest adherenace, allowing you to reach your genetic potential as everyone should."

    "plan_information": "Will's 3-2-GLP-1 is a modified version of the standard, recommended Will's 3-2-1 plan, shifted towards growth as the primary goal after recent discoveries of GLP-1 medications.  While it is the belief of Will's 3-2-1 that strength should always be prioritized over growth for maximum health, functionality and longevity, GLP-1 medications require updating.  The current findings are GLP-1s have effect on the brain and create a calorie restrictive environment, posing unique but solvable challenges that standard strength training does not address.  GLP-1 medications, indirectly, make an individual more susceptable to injuries and the calorie restriction puts greater demand on retaining muscle.  For those reasons, the core of Will's 3-2-1 is preserved with optimal performance gains each week, but modified for growth for GLP-1s.  You still get all the benefits of Will's 3-2-1, no overtraining, no undertraining, no wasted time or gains left on the table, truly humanly optimal, but in a GLP-1 aware plan."
