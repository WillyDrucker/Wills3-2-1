  REFACTORED (v5.1.2 - Definitive Spacing):
  The following rules have been updated to match the new symmetrical margin system
  established in the main active-card stylesheet. This change is critical to
  guaranteeing that the card's dimensions are static regardless of which timer
  is active, permanently eliminating any layout shift in dual-mode.

    CEMENTED (v5.0.5 - Pixel-Perfect Tuning):
    This 24px margin is the final, tuned value that creates a precise 16px visual
    gap between the bottom of the timer numbers and the top of the button below,

  CEMENTED (v5.0.5 - Architectural Fix):
  This CSS Grid is the definitive architectural solution for the dual-mode action
  area. It creates two vertically independent columns, which was the fundamental
  fix required to prevent content in one column from affecting the layout of the
  other. `align-items: start` is critical to this behavior.
